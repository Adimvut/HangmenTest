# HangmenTest
Working on an initial (partial) implementation of 
a game "Hangman" in the style of Test Driven Programming in Java by using 
Unit Testing with JUnit4 in the framework of Eclipse. Two compatible Java 
files are given to you: a source file Hangman.java and JUnit4 test case 
HangmanTest.java, both implemented partially and Hangman.java also 
containing some bugs.
